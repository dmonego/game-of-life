This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). All standard, post-eject commands are still supported.

This is a small Conway's Game of Life implementation in react/redux. To change the board, click on the individual cells to make them go live or turn off. You can also play for an individual step, or hit play to let the board run automatically. For some interesting shapes, check out the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). 

## Running this application

Clone the repo to a folder named game of life, enter the directory, download the node dependencies, then start it with yarn:
